# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Nexus Finance Core is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to facilitate lending, borrowing, staking, and KYC verification. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy integration of new features and services.

## Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

The core functionalities of the platform are implemented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The main contracts include:

- **ERC20Token**: Implements the ERC20 token standard for fungible tokens.
- **LendingPool**: Manages lending and borrowing operations.
- **Governance**: Facilitates decentralized governance through token-based voting.
- **Staking**: Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards.
- **KYC**: Manages KYC verification processes.

### 2. Backend Services

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing RESTful API endpoints for interaction with the frontend and smart contracts. Key components include:

- **API Layer**: Handles incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services.
- **Services**: Contains business logic for user management, transaction processing, and KYC handling.
- **Database**: Stores user data, transaction history, and KYC records.

### 3. Frontend

The frontend is built using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue.js) to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform. It communicates with the backend API to perform actions such as:

- User registration and login
- Viewing and managing transactions
- Staking and lending operations
- KYC verification

## Deployment

The application can be deployed on any Ethereum-compatible network. The deployment process involves:

1. Deploying smart contracts using Truffle or Hardhat.
2. Setting up the backend server with environment variables.
3. Running the frontend application.

## Conclusion

The Nexus Finance Core is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, providing a comprehensive DeFi solution for users.
